VIVOinCallimachus
=================

## Overview

This repository contains a partial implementation of the VIVO ontology (see http://www.essepuntato.it/lode/owlapi/http://vivoweb.org/ontology/core) in Callimachus (see http://callimachusproject.org).

## Usage

* Access a running Callimachus instance
* Create a new folder
* Import the Callimachus ARchive (CAR) file into the folder

## Contributing

Developers should be familiar with Callimachus and developing Callimachus applications.  Please see http://callimachusproject.org for assistance and documentation.  New developers may wish to discuss their plans on irc.freenode.net in the channel #callimachus.

Development may occur within Callimachus or directly in the Git repository, but files must eventually be committed to a clone of this repository and a pull request issued.

Thank you for any contributions!
